Not a coding man, but interested in translating English into Chinese.
I hope one day my name as a translator of a movie will be displayed on the big screen.
Also my dream job is to get a job in Netflix.
Usually, a person would hope that their parents can be proud of them, but since my parents are very district and never letting go, I think the better way would be proud of myself.
hahaha, that's all for today.
